## Evaluation Metrics

### Functional Requirements Coverage

Each problem evaluates:
- **MUST** requirements (mandatory, 100% required for pass)
- **SHOULD** requirements (important, affects score)
- **MAY** requirements (optional, bonus points)

### Non-Functional Requirements

| Metric | Weight Range | Measurement |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| Performance | 15-30% | P95/P99 latency, throughput |
| Security | 5-15% | Static analysis, runtime sandboxing |
| Code Quality | 10-15% | Complexity, coverage, documentation |
| Resource Usage | 5-10% | CPU, memory, network limits |

### Pass Criteria

- **Gold**: ≥90% total score
- **Silver**: 80-89% total score
- **Bronze**: 70-79% total score
- **Fail**: <70% total score

**Mandatory**: 100% functional correctness for all MUST requirements
