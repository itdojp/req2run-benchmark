  notes: |
    This expert-level problem tests the ability to implement a complete WebRTC-based
    video conferencing system with advanced features:
    
    - Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU) for efficient bandwidth usage
    - Adaptive bitrate control based on network conditions
    - Simulcast support for multiple quality streams
    - Conference recording with cloud storage integration
    - Screen sharing with annotation capabilities
    - Real-time quality monitoring and metrics
    - TURN/STUN server integration for NAT traversal
    - Optional end-to-end encryption for security
    
    The implementation must achieve low latency (<150ms end-to-end) while supporting
    large-scale deployments (1000 concurrent rooms, 50 participants each).
    
    Key real-time requirements:
    - Sub-150ms glass-to-glass latency
    - Adaptive quality based on network conditions
    - Graceful degradation under network stress
    - High availability and fault tolerance
    - Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
